Safe Image View
===========

A tool for stuff you'd rather not see (entirely).

To start the program you'll need Python 2.6.5 or higher (older versions might also work). Run it with

```
python saveviewer.py
```

Then simply paste a direct link to an image into the text field and click the "Load image" button. Clicking on "Depixelate" will show more detail.

##Todo:

* Imgur support: Load images from indirect imgur links
* Imgur support: Support albums
